<h2>Project brief:</h2>

Our task was to make a functional clone of the Nordstrom website. Nordstrom is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington and founded by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin in 1901. They sell various products, like cosmetics, skincare, body care, clothing, home decors etc. There are more than 350 Nordstrom, Nordstrom Local and Nordstrom Rack locations. They also serve customers online through their Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack apps and websites..

Some screenshots of our website:

The home page is the main landing page that users can interact with. It features a top and bottom navigation bar, as well as all the content in the body. The top navbar is fully responsive.


Sign Up Page
The process of creating an account, and logging into the website is the same as in the original website, where credentials are entered and verified to login. On logging in the user is redirected to the landing page.

Top Navbar
The top navbar has a feature when you hover on any of the category like men, women, kids etc., it shows all the sub categories of each respective main category. And from there you can navigate through the website.

All the pages are functional, and every product in every page is written in the form of an array of objects which is then displayed in a grid on screen. This means whenever a product is clicked, it is added to the bag. Also here you have to select the size and color of your product without that you can not proceed further.

The items on the bap page can then be viewed and then after selecting the quantity you can proceed to payment page.



On the payment page you can fill the necessary information and check the total price and then proceed to choose the payment method.
